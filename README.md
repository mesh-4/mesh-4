### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

21 yrs old. 4+ years software engineering experience. Previous work for Binance as Front-end developer.

If thing has "normal" documentation or codebase. I can adapt quickly no matter what. Not limit to any language or stack.

Currently looking for a job and building product.

*I don't have interest at Crypto for now.*
