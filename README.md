### Hi there 👋

21 yrs old. 4+ years software engineering experience. Previous work for Binance as Front-end developer.

If thing has "normal" documentation or codebase. I can adapt quickly no matter what. Not limit to any language or stack.

Currently looking for a job and building product.

Mostly with React, Typescript and Python. Still learning and try to apply ML into small scale application.
